# üì∂ SSID Tracker & WiFi Signal Strength Mapper 

A cross-platform project that scans available WiFi networks, maps their signal strength across locations within the **IIT Gandhinagar campus**, and provides an interactive heatmap and SSID details via a web interface. It supports both static and dynamic data collection modes.

---

## Requirements

Ensure you have the required Python packages installed:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
You may also need to run the script with administrator/root privileges depending on your platform, especially for WiFi scanning.

Project Overview
This project enables:

Campus-wide WiFi signal strength mapping using heatmaps

SSID tracking with security type, signal strength, and channel info

Location-specific insights via an interactive web UI

Dynamic and static data collection capabilities

‚öôÔ∏è How to Run
Run Static Web App
bash
Copy
Edit
python static_app.py
Opens a local web server that uses the static dataset from wifi_data.json.

Run Dynamic Web App with Live WiFi Scanning
Step 1: Start scanning every 10 seconds:

bash
Copy
Edit
python dynamic.py --interval 10
Step 2: Run the dynamic web app:

bash
Copy
Edit
python app.py
This will launch a live dashboard that updates with new scans at runtime.

Methodology & Implementation
WiFi Scanning
Uses platform-specific commands to scan WiFi networks and extract:

SSID (network name)

Signal strength in %, converted to dBm using:

python
Copy
Edit
signal_dbm = (signal_percent / 2) - 100
SNR (Signal-to-Noise Ratio), calculated as:

python
Copy
Edit
SNR = signal_dbm - noise_floor
A noise_floor of -95 dBm is assumed as baseline ambient noise. It helps normalize signal quality and derive more meaningful SNR values.

Also captures:

Channel

Authentication type (e.g., WPA2, Open)

Geolocation & Mapping
Each scan result is tied to a manually/geotagged campus coordinate.

Uses Leaflet.js for:

Campus boundary overlay

Heatmaps of signal strength

SSID metadata on-click popups

Implements a nearest-point algorithm to:

Determine the closest WiFi data point to a user click on the map

Provide detailed info for that location

Uses spatial interpolation to estimate signal strengths in regions without direct measurements
